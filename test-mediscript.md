Welcome to this 10-minute body scan meditation. <break time="3s" />Find a comfortable position...either sitting or lying down. <break time="3s" />Allow your eyes to gently close or soften your gaze downward as we begin today's session.

[10]

Let's start by focusing on our breathing. <break time="2.5s" />Feel the air flowing towards your nose as we slowly inhale... <break time="3s" /> and exhale completely. <break time="3s" />Again, breathe in... <break time="3s" />and let it all go. <break time="3s" />One more time, breathe in deeply... <break time="3s" />now release. <break time="2.5s" />Let's keep a steady state of breathing for the next few moments.

[15]

Now we're going to scan through our body...starting from the very top. <break time="3s" />Bring your attention to the crown of your head...just noticing whatever sensations are there. <break time="2.5s" />Maybe there's warmth...maybe coolness...or perhaps just a sense of space. <break time="3s" />Whatever you discover is exactly what should be there.

[15]

Let your awareness drift down to your forehead now. <break time="2.5s" />Notice if there's any tension here...and if there is...simply let those muscles soften. <break time="3s" />Your eyebrows can relax too.

[10]

Moving down to your eyes...even though they're gently closed. <break time="2.5s" />Feel the small muscles around your eyes beginning to release. <break time="3s" />Let this relaxation spread to your cheeks...your jaw...allowing everything to settle.

[15]

Now we'll focus on the neck and throat...an area that often holds the tension from our busy days. <break time="3s" />Just observe whatever you notice here...there's no need to change anything. <break time="2.5s" />Simply being aware is enough.

[20]

Shifting our attention now to the shoulders. <break time="2.5s" />Notice how they're positioned...are they carrying any weight from the day? <break time="3s" />If they are...that's perfectly normal. <break time="3s" />See if they'd like to drop just a little...only if that feels right.

[15]

Let's travel down through the arms now. <break time="2.5s" />First feeling into your upper arms...sensing their weight. <break time="3s" />Then the forearms...the wrists...and finally resting your attention on your hands. <break time="2.5s" />Notice your fingers...perhaps feeling them resting somewhere...connected and supported.

[25]

Bringing awareness to your chest area now. <break time="2.5s" />Feel your heart...beating steadily...doing its work. <break time="3s" />Notice your lungs...expanding and contracting naturally. <break time="3s" />Your breath is taking care of itself...you can simply observe.

[20]

Moving our attention to the back now...starting with the upper back...then the middle...and lower back. <break time="3s" />Your spine...supporting you in this moment. <break time="2.5s" />If you find areas of tension...meet them with gentle curiosity rather than resistance.

[15]

Now place your attention on your abdomen. <break time="2.5s" />Feel it rising and falling with each breath...naturally. <break time="3s" />All the organs here working quietly...supporting your life...without any effort from you.

[20]

Let's move down to your hips and pelvis now. <break time="2.5s" />Feel the weight of this area...how it's settled and supported. <break time="3s" />Let it feel heavy...grounded.

[15]

Continuing down to your thighs. <break time="2.5s" />Notice their weight...any sensations that are present. <break time="3s" />And your knees...these joints that carry you through your days...give them a moment of appreciation.

[15]

Moving to your lower legs...your calves and shins. <break time="2.5s" />Just noticing how they're positioned right now. <break time="3s" />Down to your ankles...and finally your feet. <break time="2.5s" />Your toes...the soles of your feet...feeling whatever they're touching in this moment.

[30]

Take a moment now to sense your entire body...as one whole system. <break time="3s" />From head to toe...everything connected...working together perfectly. <break time="3s" />Just appreciating this amazing body that carries you through life.

[25]

As we prepare to complete our practice...take a moment to feel grateful for your body. <break time="3s" />It breathes for you...your heart beats for you...it supports you in countless ways...all without you having to think about it.

[15]

When you're ready...begin to deepen your breath a little. <break time="3s" />Gently move your fingers and toes. <break time="3s" />And in your own time...slowly open your eyes...returning to this space around you.

<break time="3s" />Take a moment before moving on...carrying this sense of calm awareness with you.
